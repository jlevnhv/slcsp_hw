Basic usage is as follows:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb

To save STDOUT to a CSV, simply type:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb > results.csv

The program can optionally take two arguments, a zip code file and a health care plan file:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb zip_codes.csv plan_rates.csv > results.csv

This is also how the tests are run, with the very basic examples in test_zips.csv and test_plans.csv:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb test_zips.csv test_plans.csv > test_results.csv

The only result should be for zip 12345 of rate 200.

The others should fail for the following:

  23456: Ambiguous plan areas (covers 1 and 2 in test_zips.csv)
  34567: Only Bronze plan listed
  45678: Only one Silver plan listed
