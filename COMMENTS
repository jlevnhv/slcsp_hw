Basic usage is as follows:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb

To save STDOUT to a CSV, simply type:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb > results.csv

The program can optionally take two arguments, a zip code file and a health care plan file:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb zip_codes.csv plan_rates.csv > results.csv

This is also how the tests are run, with the very basic examples in test_zips.csv and test_plans.csv:

  ruby calc_slscp.rb test_zips.csv test_plans.csv > test_results.csv

The only results should be:
   12345: 200 (one rate area with several silver plans)
   56789: 100 (duplicate rate areas with several silver plans)

The others should be empty for the following reasons:

  23456: Ambiguous plan areas (covers 1 and 2 in test_zips.csv)
  34567: Only Bronze plan listed
  45678: Only one Silver plan listed

Information about environment:

  Written in vim and tested with byebug on the command line i.e.

  byebug calc_slscp.rb

Other than that, all development was on the command line and/or experimenting with Ruby hashes
using irb.
